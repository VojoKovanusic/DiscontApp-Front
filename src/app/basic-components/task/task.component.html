Java exam</h2>
<br> 
 <strong>Overview </strong> <br>For this exam you will be building a backend for a new feature of the Discount Ascii Warehouse ecommerce platform.
Your application will produce a list of "Popular purchases", so customers can see who else bought the same products as
them. To complete the exam your application will need to accept HTTP requests to /api/recent_purchases/:username and
respond with a list of recently purchased products, and the names of other users who recently purchased them. There is
no frontend component to this exam, you're just building the backend. <br><br>
<strong> Other requirement </strong><br>  your application must cache
API requests so that it can respond as quickly as possible. if a username is provided that cannot be found, the API should
respond with "User with username of '{{username}}' was not found" <br><br>
<strong>  Where does the data come from?</strong> <br>Data about users, products
and purchases is available to you via an API you can set up and host locally: https://github.com/x-team/daw-purchases/blob/master/README.md#api-reference
To work out the "Popular purchases": fetch 5 recent purchases for the user: GET /api/purchases/by_user/:username?limit=5
for each of those products, get a list of all people who previously purchased that product: GET /api/purchases/by_product/:product_id
at the same time, request info about the products: GET /api/products/:product_id finally, put all of the data together
and sort it so that the product with the highest number of recent purchases is first.
